## Controls

WASD - Movement in all directions

Space/Controller A button - Jump

Left/Right arrow keys/dpad - Swaps face you are extending

Up/Down arrow keys/dpad - Extends/retracts that face

Q/E & Controller right stick - Moves camera from left to right


Of note the arrow keys/dpad will not work if another arrow key/dpad button is already held down to prevent anything bad happening.

## Programs used

- Unity 2012.3.4f1
- Blender
- Probuilder & Progrid

## Ideas/Concept

Cross a level as a cube, you can pick a side to expand using left/right arrow keys to change sides, up and down to expand and retract

You collect floating cubes to expand your expand ability cap

You cannot expand a side different from the one you picked, hense pick a side

Player - Square
Scientist - Spherical
Spikes - Triangles

Spikes are alive, but they're just doing their job
Maybe some dialogue between levels between the scientist and the player's cube

Forcefields can block player until they press a button
