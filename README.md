Cross a level as a cube, you can pick a side to expand using left/right arrow keys to change sides, up and down to expand and retract

You collect floating cubes to expand your expand ability cap

Player - Square
Scientist - Spherical
Spikes - Triangles

Spikes are alive, but they're just doing their job
Maybe some dialogue between levels between the scientist and the player's cube

Forcefields can block player until they press a button
